Linting
-------

It is possible to check the code using PyLint.
A suitable .pylintrc configuration is included.
Simple move to the base directory and run:

    $ pylint flask_micron

I do not perform linting on the tests/ directory. 

The Makefile provides two targets for running linting:

    $ make lint         to perform a single lint run
    $ make lint-watch   to perform continuous lint runs
