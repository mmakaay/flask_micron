A method-oriented microservice JSON framework on top of the excellent
Flask package, focusing on security and productivity.

Basic features:

- Business logic is separated from request handling.

What does the name stand for?
-----------------------------

Micron was chosen for a couple of reasons:

 - I admit... primarily it simply was the coolest name from a bunch of
   names that I was able to come up with.

 - Micron is a contraction of the words "Microservice" and "JSON".

 - I started out with "JsonAPI", but that would have implied an
   implementation of the protocol as described by jsonapi.org, which
   this is not.

 - Where would any UNIX hacker be without a recursive acronym?
   "Micron Is Communicating Restless Object Notation"

 - I liked that it refers to both Flask being a micro framework and
   the concept of microservices.
