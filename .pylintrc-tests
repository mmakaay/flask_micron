# no-self-use:
# too-few-public-method:
#   In the tests, there are many small classes, e.g. for creating a
#   simple test plugin or an actual unittest TestCase that only has a
#   few tests in it.
# missing-docstring:
#   In the tests, we'll not be documenting every element in the code.
# invalid-name:
#   I do use a format that looks like this example:
#   "test_InvalidIdentifier_RaisesException". This does not follow the standard
#   naming for Python, but I do find this very practical naming for testing.
# too-many-public-methods:
#   Test cases can have a lot of test methods, which is not a problem.
# expression-not-assigned:
#   Sometimes, properties are accessed without using their value. This is
#   for example done to check if in certain cases an exception is raised
#   from an accessor function.
# ununsed-variable:
#   Disabled, because @micron.method() decorators used on a function makes
#   the function an unused variable, when we're not actively using the
#   function afterwards. We do use the function, but we do so by calling
#   it via a test request.
# locally-disabled:
#   Some minor issues are suppressed at the file level using pylint hints
#   in the file header. I am not interested in warnings about these.
