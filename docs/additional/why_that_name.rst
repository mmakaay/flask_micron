What does 'Micron' stand for?
=============================

The name 'Micron' was chosen for a couple of reasons:

* Micron is a contraction of the words 'Microservice' and 'JSON'.

* I started out with the name 'JsonAPI', but that would have implied an
  implementation of the protocol as described by http://jsonapi.org.

* Where would UNIX hackers be without recursive acronyms? 'Micron Is
  Communicating Restless Object Notation'

* I liked that it refers to both Flask being a microframework and
  the concept of microservices.

* Admittedly, it was the coolest from a bunch of names that I was able to
  come up with. Naming stuff in code is hard, naming projects even harder.
