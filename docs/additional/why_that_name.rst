What does 'Micron' stand for?
=============================

The name 'Flask-Micron' was chosen for a couple of reasons:

* Micron is a contraction of the words 'Microservice' and 'JSON'.

* I started out with the name 'Flask-JsonAPI', but that would have implied
  an implementation of the protocol as described by http://jsonapi.org.

* Where would UNIX hackers be without their recursive acronyms?
  'Micron Is Communicating Restless Object Notation'

* I liked that it refers to `Flask`_ being a microframework and
  the concept of microservices.

* Admittedly, it was the coolest from a bunch of names that I was able to
  come up with. Naming stuff in code is hard, naming projects even harder!
