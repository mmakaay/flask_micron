Installation
============

Install the Flask-Micron extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Flask-Micron

or alternatively if you have *pip* installed::

    $ pip install Flask-Micron

This will also install the :ref:`dependencies <dependencies>` for
Flask-Micron.

Also take a look at the `Flask Installation Documentation`_, especially
the information about the use of virtualenv for development purposes.
