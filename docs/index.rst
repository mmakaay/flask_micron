   :class: floatright

Flask-Micron is a pluggable, method-oriented API framework for Python,
focusing on security and productivity. It is built on top of the excellent
`Flask`_ microframework.

The main goal for the project is to make it really simple for developers to
write microservice-style JSON webservices, honoring best practices for
security, and without having to pollute business logic code with HTTP
request handling knowledge.
